## Sundial ðŸš§

Sundial is a library written in pure [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) which partially implements the [iCalendar spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545) to support parsing of RRules.

### Current high level features to be supported in this project

- Ability to parse an RRule to a json representation

- Ability to extract an RRule implementation from a given json

- Ability to generate next iteration/iterations given an RRule string
